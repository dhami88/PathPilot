# PathPilot: Optimized Route-Finder (Using Graph Algorithms)

PathPilot is a C++ project that implements optimized pathfinding using **Dijkstraâ€™s algorithm** on a weighted graph. It is designed to compute efficient travel routes while considering multiple constraints such as **distance**, **travel time**, and **cost**.
